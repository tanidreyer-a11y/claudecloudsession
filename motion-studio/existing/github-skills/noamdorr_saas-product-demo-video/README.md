# SaaS Product Demo Video Skill for Remotion

A skill for producing a 20-45 second SaaS product demo video in [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/). End-to-end: asset intake, beat detection from the soundtrack, schematic UI mockups when the product has no real UI to film, scene composition, and final render.

It's packaged as a Claude Code skill (that's where it's been used in production), but the methodology is LLM-agnostic. The questionnaire, the references, the Python + bash scripts, the React/Remotion code templates - all just markdown and code.

## What you get

- A structured asset-intake questionnaire that pulls all the brand specifics upfront (logo, fonts, colors, soundtrack, copy, references) before a single scene gets composed - so what you ship feels yours, not template-y
- A reference-video analysis flow that pulls directorial vocabulary from YouTube clips you point at (push-through, whip-pan, V-cut pull-back, match-cut zoom)
- librosa-powered beat detection from your soundtrack
- Snare-locked scene boundaries plus a one-pass aligner for in-scene events (the single highest-leverage iteration after the first render)
- Animation primitives (TypedText, MaskReveal, PopIn, Counter, IceCrack, Cursor, BRollLayer)
- Schematic UI templates for products without a real UI - LinkedIn-style profile card, email composer, API panel
- A pre-render writing-style check that catches em-dashes, curly quotes, and other AI-tells before they ship on screen
- A click-positioning playbook that solves the #1 iteration-churn complaint ("the cursor missed the button")

## Example output

Here's what the skill produced for [Reechee](https://reechee.io) (30s, 16:9, motion graphics + collage b-roll):

[![Reechee product demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/84dbi9LvWwM/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84dbi9LvWwM)

The skill renders MP4s suitable for LinkedIn, YouTube, or homepage hero embeds. HD by default, optional 4K via `--scale=2`.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) - macOS, Linux, or Windows (on Windows, the two bash scripts need [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads); the Python and Node parts run natively)
- An LLM coding agent - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) gives you the auto-trigger and Super Powers integration; Codex / Cursor / Aider / others work too if you point them at `SKILL.md` directly
- [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) 4.x dependencies (the skill scaffolds these for you, no manual setup)
- Python [`librosa`](https://librosa.org/) for beat detection (the skill walks you through `pip install` if it's missing)

### Strongly recommended (with fallbacks)

- **[Super Powers plugin](https://github.com/obra/superpowers).** When present, the skill orchestrates `superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:writing-plans`, and `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`. Without it, the workflow becomes more conversational and a bit slower - but everything still works.
- **Gemini access for reference-video analysis.** Three paths in priority order; the skill picks whichever is highest available:
  1. [`gemini` CLI](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart) on PATH (or a community wrapper like `gemini-yt`) - one-liner wrap
  2. `GEMINI_API_KEY` set in env - use the bundled curl wrapper
  3. None of the above - fall back to manual [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) copy-paste

## Install

The skill ships as a `.skill` archive (it's just a zip with a different extension). Drop it into your Claude Code plugins directory.

> **Using a different agent?** Skip the `.skill` install and use **Option B** below. After cloning, point your agent at `saas-product-demo-video/SKILL.md` and it'll have the same content - the auto-trigger and Super Powers orchestration are the only things you'll miss.

### Option A - one-line install from the latest release

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/noamdorr/saas-product-demo-video/releases/latest/download/saas-product-demo-video.skill \
  -o ~/.claude/plugins/saas-product-demo-video.skill
```

### Option B - clone and link

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noamdorr/saas-product-demo-video.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/saas-product-demo-video/saas-product-demo-video" ~/.claude/skills/saas-product-demo-video
```

Use this one if you want to fork and tweak (which I'd encourage - the references are written to be edited).

### Option C - manual

1. Download `saas-product-demo-video.skill` from the [latest release](https://github.com/noamdorr/saas-product-demo-video/releases/latest)
2. Move it into your Claude Code plugins directory (typically `~/.claude/plugins/`)
3. Restart Claude Code

After install, ask Claude Code something like *"let's make a 30-second product demo for my SaaS"* and the skill should auto-trigger.

## How a session looks

```
You: I want to make a 30-second product video for my SaaS.

Claude (skill triggers, asks intake questions):
  1. Aspect ratio?
  2. Duration?
  3. Logo (SVG / PNG dimensions)?
  4. Brand colors?
  5. Fonts?
  6. Copy / script?
  7. Voiceover?
  8. Soundtrack?

You: [answer or tell Claude to pick defaults]

Claude:
  - Runs detect-beats.py against your soundtrack
  - Asks for 2-3 YouTube reference videos
  - Either runs the Gemini analysis script or walks you through AI Studio
  - Writes a spec doc + implementation plan
  - Builds primitives → schematic UI → scenes → master
  - Renders Scene 1 for your approval
  - Iterates in waves based on your feedback
  - Renders the final HD MP4 + thumbnail
```

In practice you land a polished video in roughly 60-120 minutes of Claude wallclock time, broken across however many sessions you want. Most of those minutes go into iterating on Scene 1 until the style feels right - once it locks, the rest of the scenes inherit the same vocabulary and finish fast.

## Development

To rebuild the `.skill` archive after editing:

```bash
./build.sh
# Produces saas-product-demo-video.skill at the repo root
```

That's all `build.sh` does - it's a glorified `zip` with a different extension. No install step, no compile step.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Open an issue first if you're planning a non-trivial change, so we don't both build the same thing differently. Keep edits to `SKILL.md` lean (it's loaded into Claude's context every time the skill triggers); deeper content goes in `references/`.

Built by [Noam Dorr](https://github.com/noamdorr). This sits on top of [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/) (the React-based video framework that makes any of this possible) and the [Super Powers plugin](https://github.com/obra/superpowers), which gave me the brainstorming → spec → plan → build loop the skill orchestrates around.
