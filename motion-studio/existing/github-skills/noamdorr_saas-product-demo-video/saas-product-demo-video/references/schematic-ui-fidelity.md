# Schematic UI fidelity - designing fake UI that earns trust

When the user's product has no real UI to record (early-stage, API-only, or browser-extension-only), scenes that "show the product working" need invented schematic UIs. This is its own design discipline - generic placeholder boxes look amateurish; convincing schematic UIs read as polished without being literal.

## When you need this

- Demo scenes that show "the product on a website" but the product is a Chrome extension, an API, or a CLI.
- Scenes that show third-party platforms (LinkedIn, Gmail, Slack) where you can't legally record real screenshots.
- Scenes that show data visualizations or dashboards that don't yet exist in production.

## The "adjacent but not exact" naming pattern

The cardinal rule: schematic UIs should *evoke* a real platform without copying it. The viewer should think "ah, this is the LinkedIn moment" without you using LinkedIn's actual brand assets.

Concrete patterns:

| Real platform | Schematic equivalent |
|---|---|
| LinkedIn header (`#0A66C2` blue) | Slate-blue gradient (`#3D5A80`) - adjacent but desaturated |
| Gmail compose | Coral border + cream bg + your brand title bar |
| Slack thread | Cream bubbles + your brand avatar circles |
| Stripe Checkout | Your brand colors + a familiar layout (logo, line items, button) |

Never use the actual brand color, logo, or trademarked icon from the platform you're evoking. Either you'll get a takedown, or the scene reads as a real product screenshot and you've now mis-attributed credit.

## Use the product's real strings and tokens

The "adjacent but not exact" rule above is for platforms the product does *not* integrate. For the user's *own* product UI, the opposite applies: pull the real strings straight from the actual components - the exact status words, the precise ETA phrasing, the real column order - rather than inventing plausible-looking copy. Real strings read as "their product"; invented ones read as "a SaaS." A status that says "burns out ~Thursday" because that is what the app literally renders is worth more than a tidier-sounding label nobody on the team recognizes.

Same for theme: import the app's design-token file (colors, fonts, radii) instead of hand-copying hex values into the schematic. The clip is then auto on-brand, and it stays in sync as the brand evolves - a palette change in the product propagates to the film for free, with no second source of truth to drift.

(This is only for UI the product actually owns. For tools it does not integrate, keep the adjacent-but-not-exact rule above - evoke, never copy.)

## Components, not screenshots

Build schematic UIs as React components, not as static images. Components let you:

- Drive content from data (personas, products, pricing).
- Animate in primitives (cursor clicks, button squishes, card slides).
- Reuse across scenes with different props.

Skip Photoshop or Figma exports. Inline SVG + CSS rendered components scale to 4K cleanly.

## Three reference patterns

### 1. Schematic profile card (LinkedIn-ish)

For "view a prospect's profile" scenes:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ████████████████ slate gradient header █████│
│   ⬤                                  [pill] │
│                                             │
│   ⬤  cutout-style avatar                   │
│                                             │
│   Sarah Chen                                │
│   Head of RevOps at Ramp                    │
│   San Francisco, CA                         │
│                                             │
│   [+ Connect]                               │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Visual cues that signal "professional network":
- Slate-blue gradient header bar
- Profile photo in a circle, overlapping the header bottom edge
- Name in heavy display weight
- Title + company on one line, lighter weight
- Location on a third line, mutest gray
- "Connect" pill button in slate, white text, rounded

What NOT to include:
- Real LinkedIn blue (`#0A66C2`) - pick a desaturated slate instead
- "in" wordmark in any form
- LinkedIn's three-dot menu icon

### 2. Schematic email composer

For "the bad email" or "compose a message" scenes:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ New Message                          ⬤ ⬤ ⬤ │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ To       sarah@ramp.com                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Subject  Quick intro                       │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Congrats on your Series A 👋               │
│ |                                           │
│                                             │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Send]                              🗑      │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Visual cues:
- Branded title bar at top (your brand color, not Gmail red)
- Three dots in title bar (close/minimize/expand)
- Two header rows: "To" and "Subject"
- Body area where typing happens
- Bottom action bar: brand-colored Send button + a recycle bin or archive icon (recycle bin reads as "delete" more clearly)

### 3. Schematic API panel (developer-facing)

For "the product is an API" scenes:

```
┌──────────────── REQUEST ─────────────────┐
│┃                                          │
│┃  POST  https://yourapi.example.com/v1/x  │
│┃  ─────────────────────────────────────   │
│┃                                          │
│┃  {                                       │
│┃    "linkedin": "in/sarahchen"            │
│┃  }                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌──────────────── RESPONSE ────────────────┐
│┃  [200 OK]                                 │
│┃                                          │
│┃  {                                       │
│┃    "icebreaker": "Saw your..."           │
│┃  }                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Visual cues:
- Vertical accent rule on the left (your brand color, ~4px)
- Mono font (JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono)
- Soft paper-cutout shadow for warmth (vs flat tech)
- "200 OK" status pill in your brand color
- JSON in graphite, never bright-colored syntax highlighting

What NOT to include:
- Real API endpoints from competitors
- Authentic-looking tokens or API keys (even fake ones can read as a real leak)

## Inventing personas

Schematic UIs need fake people. Make them up cleanly:

- **Names** that don't accidentally match real public figures. Mix common first names with common last names ("Sarah Chen", "Marcus Reyes", "Priya Iyer").
- **Job titles** that match the target audience of the product. For a B2B SaaS targeting RevOps, prospects should be RevOps / Founding GTM / Outbound Lead at recognizable B2B companies.
- **Companies** that are real but unrelated to the user's actual customers. Pick well-known B2B SaaS (Ramp, Linear, Vanta, Notion). Avoid names of the user's actual customers.
- **Photos** as paper-cutout silhouettes or AI-generated portraits, NOT photos of real people scraped from the internet.

Document the persona inventory in a `data/personas.ts` file.

## Brand consistency across schematic UIs

All schematic UIs in the same film should use:

- The same brand palette (don't introduce new colors in schematic UIs).
- The same fonts (display + UI + mono - no rogue typefaces).
- The same shadow / corner radius / border treatments.

This is what separates a polished schematic from a placeholder. The schematic UI feels like *your brand* expressing *another platform's idea* - not a generic mockup.

## Vary repeated rows or it reads fake

A mock dashboard or table where every row has the same sparkline shape, the same trend, and the same value instantly looks synthetic - real data has spread. Vary each row *deterministically* by seeding a hash off the row index (see `animation-patterns.md` -> "Deterministic variation (never Math.random)"), so the spread is reproducible across renders rather than reshuffling every frame. Drive trend shape, balance, and status from that seed: some rows trending down, some flat, a couple healthy and one in the danger state. A dashboard that looks lived-in sells the product; eight identical rows announce that it's a prop.

## Animating schematic UIs

Schematic UIs are static React components. To animate them, wrap with primitives:

```tsx
<SlidePopIn startFrame={0} fromY={80}>
  <BreathingPulse startFrame={20}>
    <SchematicProfileCard persona={sarah} />
  </BreathingPulse>
</SlidePopIn>
```

The schematic doesn't know it's being animated. This separation keeps the components clean and reusable.

For interactions (cursor clicks on a button inside the schematic), use either:

- A computed click target (`SCHEMATIC_PROFILE_CARD_LAYOUT.brandButton.center` exported from the component).
- A render-time bounding-box ref (via `getBoundingClientRect()` on a `useRef`).

See `references/click-positioning.md` for the trade-offs.

## Past production note

The Meltly demo invented three schematic UIs:

- Profile card (LinkedIn-ish) - used in scenes 4 and 6, with 4 different personas.
- Email composer - used in scene 3, with one fake email body.
- API panel - used in scene 8, with one fake request/response.

All three were defined as React components in `src/ui/`, parameterized by data props, and wrapped with animation primitives in scenes. Total component lines: ~250. Total schematic-UI-related iteration churn: 3 small fixes across 4 waves (most flagged by the user as "the click missed the button" - see `click-positioning.md`).
