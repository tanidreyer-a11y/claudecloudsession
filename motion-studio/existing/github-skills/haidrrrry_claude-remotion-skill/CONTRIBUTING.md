# Contributing

This is an active, open-source project — contributions welcome. 🙌

## Ways to help

- **New motion patterns** — add a reusable component to `remotion-motion-graphics/references/motion-patterns.md`.
- **New palettes / type / pacing** — extend `remotion-motion-graphics/references/design-rules.md`.
- **Theme presets** — improve `remotion-motion-graphics/assets/theme.ts`.
- **Docs & examples** — clearer install steps, usage recipes, demo clips.
- **Bug fixes** — broken rules, wrong code, typos.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b my-improvement`.
3. Make your change. Keep motion patterns deterministic and `fps`-derived (follow the 10 rules in `SKILL.md`).
4. Commit with a clear message.
5. Open a Pull Request describing what and why. Screenshots/clips of rendered output are very welcome.

## Guidelines

- Keep it framework-true: real Remotion + TypeScript, no pseudo-code.
- One concern per PR.
- If you add a pattern, show it actually renders.
- If you touch anything under `remotion-motion-graphics/`, run
  `scripts/build-skill.sh` so the `.skill` Desktop artifact stays in sync.

Questions or ideas? Open an issue. New contributors and first PRs are encouraged.
