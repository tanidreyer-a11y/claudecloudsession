# motion-graphics

Motion-graphics skills for Claude Code. Each skill does one job. The first one is **`motion-broll`**.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `motion-broll` | Give it a video and a transcript and it makes motion-graphic B-roll timed to your words. |

More skills will be added to this repo.

## motion-broll

**Motion-graphic B-roll for your videos, made by Claude Code.** Give it a video and a transcript and it plans, animates and renders clips timed to your words. Each clip is one continuous shape that keeps morphing (pill → card → terminal → chart) and never cuts, with a cursor driving every change.

## What you get

You run `/motion-broll`, answer a few questions, approve a plan, and get back:

- **The clips**, named by where they go on your timeline (`04-master-prompt_0m32s40.mp4`). Full-frame cutaways are MP4. Panels that sit in empty space next to you are transparent ProRes 4444 `.mov`.
- **A preview render** of your video with the clips cut in.
- **`compare.html`**: original vs. with motion graphics, synced, as side by side, stacked or wipe.
- **`viewer.html`**: step through the clips one by one.
- **`TIMING.md`**: every clip with its in/out point and the line it covers.

The preview is for review. For your final cut, drop the clips into your own editor.

## Install

```
npx skills add Barty-Bart/motion-graphics
```

That installs the skills from this repo (pick `motion-broll`). It works in Claude Code and other agents that read skills.

Or copy `skills/motion-broll` into your project's `.claude/skills/` (or `~/.claude/skills/` to use it everywhere).

**Requirements:** Node 18+, Python 3, and ffmpeg (with the ProRes encoder, standard in Homebrew builds). On first run the skill installs Playwright and Chromium into a local `motion/` folder.

## Use it

```
/motion-broll
```

Then point it at your video and transcript (an SRT from your editor, Descript or YouTube works). It will:

1. **Inspect the footage.** It reads resolution, frame rate and layout, including picture-in-picture sections and whether the box changes size.
2. **Estimate word timings** from your transcript.
3. **Plan the clips** in a table and wait for your OK. For each clip it chooses a full-frame cutaway, a transparent panel in empty space, or nothing, and tells you why.
4. **Build each clip**, check stills on the key words, and fix what's off.
5. **Render** with motion blur at your video's frame rate, then make the preview and the comparison pages.

It never invents numbers or results. Bars show relative size and text uses skeleton lines until you give it the real figures.

## How it works

- Every frame is a pure function of time. Springs are closed-form step responses, and a value that changes target many times is the sum of one spring per change. There are no CSS transitions or timers, so any frame can be rendered on its own.
- Clips are small HTML files on a shared engine (`skills/motion-broll/engine/motion.js`). Headless Chromium captures 4 sub-frames per frame across a 180° shutter, and ffmpeg blends them into motion blur.
- The worked example in `skills/motion-broll/examples/opus-aoe2/` is the six clips from the demo above.
