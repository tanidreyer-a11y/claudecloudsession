# Remotion Superpowers — Setup Wizard

You are running the setup wizard for the Remotion Superpowers plugin. Follow these steps carefully and guide the user through each one.

## Step 1: Check System Dependencies

Run these checks and report results:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
python3 --version 2>/dev/null || python --version 2>/dev/null
which uvx 2>/dev/null || echo "uvx not found"
```

**Required:**
- Node.js >= 18 (needed for Remotion and MCP servers)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

**Recommended:**
- Python 3 + `uv`/`uvx` (needed for ElevenLabs and Pexels MCP servers)
  - If missing, tell user: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

Report each as ✓ or ✗ with version.

## Step 2: Check Remotion Project

Check if the current directory has a `remotion.config.ts` or `remotion.config.js` file.

**If YES:** Tell the user their Remotion project was detected.

**If NO:** Ask the user if they want to:
- Create a new Remotion project here: `npx create-video@latest`
  - Recommend: Blank template, yes to TailwindCSS, yes to install Skills
- Or navigate to an existing Remotion project first

Do NOT proceed until the user is in a Remotion project directory.

## Step 3: Install Remotion Agent Skills

Check if `.claude/skills/remotion-best-practices/` exists.

**If not installed:**
```bash
npx skills add remotion-dev/skills
```

Tell the user: "Remotion best practices skills installed. Claude now knows Remotion's APIs, animation patterns, audio handling, and more."

## Step 4: Configure API Keys

Walk the user through each API key. For each one:
1. Explain what the service provides
2. Give the signup URL
3. Tell them the environment variable name
4. Ask them to set it: `export VAR_NAME=their-key`
5. Recommend adding to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` for persistence

### 4a. KIE API Key (PRIMARY — covers Suno + ElevenLabs + more)
- **What:** Single API key that provides music generation (Suno), sound effects (ElevenLabs SFX), text-to-speech (ElevenLabs TTS), image generation, video generation, and subtitle generation.
- **Signup:** https://kie.ai — create account, get API key from dashboard
- **Variable:** `KIE_API_KEY`
- **Command:** `export KIE_API_KEY=your-key-here`
- **Persistence:** `echo 'export KIE_API_KEY=your-key-here' >> ~/.zshrc`

### 4b. TwelveLabs API Key (VIDEO UNDERSTANDING — "eyes")
- **What:** Gives Claude the ability to "see" video files — analyze footage, find specific scenes, detect objects and speakers, generate summaries. This is how the plugin understands existing video in your project folders.
- **Signup:** https://www.twelvelabs.io — create account, get API key from dashboard
- **Variable:** `TWELVELABS_API_KEY`
- **Command:** `export TWELVELABS_API_KEY=your-key-here`
- **Persistence:** `echo 'export TWELVELABS_API_KEY=your-key-here' >> ~/.zshrc`

### 4c. Pexels API Key (FREE STOCK FOOTAGE)
- **What:** Free stock photos and videos. Search by keyword, download HD/4K clips directly into your project.
- **Signup:** https://www.pexels.com/api/ — completely free, create account and get key instantly
- **Variable:** `PEXELS_API_KEY`
- **Command:** `export PEXELS_API_KEY=your-key-here`
- **Persistence:** `echo 'export PEXELS_API_KEY=your-key-here' >> ~/.zshrc`

### 4d. ElevenLabs API Key (OPTIONAL — advanced voice features)
- **What:** Direct access to the full ElevenLabs platform — voice cloning, custom voices, advanced TTS controls, audio isolation. The basic TTS/SFX is already covered by KIE, but this gives you premium voice features.
- **Signup:** https://elevenlabs.io — free tier with 10k credits/month
- **Variable:** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- **Command:** `export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here`
- **Persistence:** `echo 'export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here' >> ~/.zshrc`
- **Note:** This is optional. Skip if you don't need voice cloning or custom voices.

### 4e. Replicate API Token (OPTIONAL — advanced AI image/video models)
- **What:** Access to 100+ AI models on Replicate — FLUX for images, Wan/Kling/Veo for video generation, image-to-video, upscaling, and more. Goes beyond the built-in KIE models when you need specific styles or capabilities.
- **Signup:** https://replicate.com — create account, get API token from dashboard
- **Variable:** `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
- **Command:** `export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here`
- **Persistence:** `echo 'export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your-token-here' >> ~/.zshrc`
- **Note:** This is optional. Skip if the built-in image/video generation from KIE is sufficient.

After each key, ask the user to confirm they've set it before moving to the next one. It's OK to skip optional ones.

## Step 5: Reload Shell & Verify

Tell the user to reload their shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Then verify the environment variables are set:
```bash
echo "KIE_API_KEY: ${KIE_API_KEY:+SET}" 
echo "TWELVELABS_API_KEY: ${TWELVELABS_API_KEY:+SET}"
echo "PEXELS_API_KEY: ${PEXELS_API_KEY:+SET}"
echo "ELEVENLABS_API_KEY: ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY:+SET}"
echo "REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: ${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN:+SET}"
```

## Step 6: Verify MCP Connections

Tell the user to check MCP server status:
```
/mcp
```

All configured servers should show as connected. If any fail:
- Check that the API key environment variable is set
- For `uvx`-based servers, ensure `uv` is installed
- For `npx`-based servers, ensure Node.js is installed
- Try restarting Claude Code
