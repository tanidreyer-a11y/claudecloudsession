  Create a premium, cinematic app / SaaS promotional video with Remotion, in the
  motion-language of a REFERENCE video you provide. The skill watches your
  reference (via the `watch` skill), studies YOUR app from its screenshots + logo
  + description, reverse-engineers the reference's creative direction, then designs
  and builds a completely original launch film — with AI voiceover and mapped sound
  design — and renders it vertical (9:16), landscape (16:9), and App Store sizes.
  Use when the user wants a product/app/SaaS launch or promo video, an App Store /
  Play Store preview video, or "a promo like <some video>".

# Promo Video — reference-driven, premium app launch films

You are an **Elite Motion Graphics Director + Senior Remotion/React/TypeScript
engineer + Creative Director**. Your work looks premium, cinematic, production-ready
— comparable to launch films from Apple, Stripe, Linear, Vercel, OpenAI, Meta,
Google, Adobe. You never rush; you think like a creative director before writing
a line of code.

This skill turns one reference video + one app's assets into an original, on-brand
launch film. Follow the steps **in order**. Do not skip the analysis. Do not copy
the reference — recreate its *quality, pacing, motion language and cinematic feel*
using the user's brand.

`SKILL_DIR` = the directory containing this file. Its layout:
- `prompt/creative-director-prompt.md` — the exact master brief. **Read it and follow it.**
- `docs/motion-language.md` — the reusable motion principles (spring-everything, word→thing, etc.).
- `docs/example-breakdown.md` — a fully worked reference breakdown, as a model for the depth expected.
- `template/` — a complete, working Remotion starter (all shared components, animations, 4 compositions, audio builder). This is your infrastructure + reference implementation.

## Step 0 — Preflight (once)

1. **Video watching engine.** This skill relies on the `watch` skill to see the
   reference video. Check it's available (Claude Code plugin `bradautomates/claude-video`,
   or `npx skills add bradautomates/claude-video -g`). If it isn't installed, tell the
   user how to install it, or ask them to paste a timestamped breakdown / frames instead.
2. **Tooling.** Confirm `node`, `npm`/`npx`, `python3`, `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `curl`
   are on PATH (`ffmpeg -version`, `python3 --version`). Remotion needs Node ≥ 18.
3. **Voiceover (optional but recommended).** VO uses OpenRouter TTS
   (`openai/gpt-audio`, voice `coral`). If the user wants VO, get an
   `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. If not, the film still renders — set `AUDIO_SRC = null`
   in `theme.ts` or build an SFX-only master.

## Step 1 — Gather inputs (ask, don't guess)

Collect, via `AskUserQuestion` where it's a real choice and plain questions otherwise:

1. **Reference video** — the URL (YouTube/Loom/TikTok/… anything yt-dlp supports) or a local path. This defines the motion language to emulate.
2. **The app** — name, one-line tagline, and a real description of what it does and its top features (in priority order).
3. **Assets folder** — absolute path to their screenshots, logo, and any brand graphics. (Screenshots should be clean, real app screens; logo ideally with the wordmark.)
4. **Deliverables** — orientation(s): vertical 9:16 (Reels/TikTok/Shorts/Stories + App Store), landscape 16:9 (YouTube/web), or both; and whether they need **App Store preview** sizes (886×1920 / 1920×886, ≤30s, 30fps).
5. **Voiceover** — yes/no, and any voice/tone preference (default: warm female `coral`).
6. **Duration** — default 33s (the template's timing). Only change if asked.

## Step 2 — Watch & reverse-engineer the reference

Use the `watch` skill on the reference URL at a detail that yields ~30–40 frames.
**Read the frames yourself** — do not trust a text summary. Then write a genuine,
scene-by-scene breakdown (see `docs/example-breakdown.md` for the required depth):
macro-structure and beat count, every transition, camera move (usually simulated via
CSS 3D perspective, not a real camera), typography technique, icon/UI animation,
motion principles, pacing (beats-per-second), color & light, composition, and *why
each scene works*. This breakdown is section 1 of the deliverable document.

## Step 3 — Study the app (inspect, don't assume)

`Read` every screenshot and the logo in the assets folder. Note the real UI, the
signature screens (the "money shot" — e.g. a result/score screen), the exact brand
colors (sample them), the logo construction, and the type personality. If a code
repo is provided, skim it for features/flow. Write section 2 (app analysis:
what it does, strongest selling points, unique features, user benefits, the best
story to tell, best feature order) and section 3 (creative direction: mood, style,
palette, motion language, type, icons, backgrounds, camera style, pacing, animation
philosophy) — translating the reference's grammar into the app's world.

## Step 4 — Storyboard + production plan

Write section 4 (a scene-by-scene storyboard: purpose, duration, VO, on-screen text,
animations, camera, transition, SFX, UI animation) and section 5 (production plan:
folder structure, components, shared animations, utilities, assets, fonts, audio,
rendering, optimization). Save the whole document as `CREATIVE_DIRECTION.md` in the
new project. **Read `prompt/creative-director-prompt.md` and satisfy every point in it.**

## Step 5 — Scaffold from the template

Copy `template/` to the user's chosen output dir (e.g. `<app>-promo/`). It ships with:
- **Shared components** (all orientation-agnostic, size-driven): `PhoneFrame`,
  `GlassCard`, `Cursor` (hand cursor that presses real UI), `Confetti`, `KineticWords`
  (keyword-colored word-by-word builder), `Bloom` (light-bloom stitch), `Whoosh`
  (gradient wipe), `Particles`, `ScoreRing` (radial gauge), `ScanButton`, `FontLoader`.
- **Animation layer** (`springs.ts`, `easings.ts`, `motion.ts`) — one motion vocabulary.
- **`Root.tsx`** — 4 compositions: `PromoVertical` 1080×1920, `PromoLandscape`
  1920×1080, `PromoStorePortrait` 886×1920, `PromoStoreLandscape` 1920×886.
- **9 example scenes** — the reference implementation of the word→thing→word→thing
  structure (Hook → One-tap → Press → Verdict/reward → "More than…" → Device orbit →
  Dashboard → Tagline → Logo). Every scene is orientation-aware via `const wide = width > height`.
- **`scripts/build_audio.py`** — streaming OpenRouter VO + meaningful SFX → one master.
- **`public/sfx/`, `public/fonts/`** — reusable, brand-agnostic.

Then `cd` in and `npm install`.

## Step 6 — Make it the user's film

Customize, don't just fill blanks — this must feel bespoke:
- **`src/theme.ts`** — replace `COLORS` with the sampled brand palette; point `screens`
  and `LOGO` at the user's assets; pick fonts in `src/fonts.ts` (match the type
  personality). Keep `T`/`dur` unless you change the duration (then rebuild audio).
- **Assets** — drop screenshots into `public/app-screens/` and the logo (with wordmark)
  into `public/logo/app-logo.png`; update the `screens` map keys/paths to match.
- **Scenes** — rewrite each scene's copy, the featured screens, the hero "money-shot"
  beat, chips/labels, tagline (period-rhythm, keyword-colored), and the logo lockup for
  the app. Keep the motion language (`docs/motion-language.md`): spring-everything,
  float-idle, single-hero, light-bloom + whoosh stitches, cursor-presses-real-UI,
  a reward beat, period-rhythm tagline. **Guard credibility**: never show a screen that
  contradicts an overlay; avoid alarming empty-states; don't invent stats.
- **`scripts/build_audio.py`** — rewrite the `VO` script (one concise warm line per
  scene, timed to `T`, with at least 0.25s between measured takes and no overlapping
  narrators). The runtime splits camel-cased product names such as `SafeMama` into
  clear spoken words while preserving the wordmark. Rewrite the `FX` timeline (map
  each effect to its on-screen action:
  click on taps, pop on lands, whoosh on moves, chime+sparkle on the reward/brand,
  tick-train while "AI thinks").

## Step 7 — Build audio (if VO/SFX wanted)

`export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-..." && python3 scripts/build_audio.py`. It caches
takes (deterministic re-runs), silence-trims to cues, fits each line to its window
(pitch-preserving `atempo`, capped so nothing sounds rushed), normalizes + places SFX,
and limits the master to −1 dB. If no VO: set `AUDIO_SRC = null` or strip the `VO` list.

## Step 8 — Verify, then render

- **Iterate visually.** Render still frames (`npx remotion still <Comp> out/f.png --frame=N`)
  at each beat and `Read` them. Fix collisions, overflow, contradictions, off-brand color.
  Do this for every orientation you ship (narrow 886 and short 886 frames especially).
- **Render** the chosen deliverables: `npm run render:vertical`, `:landscape`,
  `:store`, `:store-wide`. All share the same audio master (timing is frame-locked).

## Step 9 — App Store cut (if requested)

App Previews must be **≤30s, 30fps, exact device size** (iPhone 6.5": 886×1920 or
1920×886). The 33s film needs ~3s trimmed. Prefer a **gentle global speed-up (~6%)
plus a harder speed-up at the silent gaps between VO lines** (so no spoken word is
chopped), then output 30fps. Use `docs/appstore-cut.md` recipe (ffmpeg segment
remap). Never letterbox or stretch — render the 886 composition natively.

## Quality bar

Every animation intentional; every frame premium; every transition smooth; every
movement reinforcing the story. If something is off, fix it and re-render — don't ship
a money-shot with a collision, a contradiction, or a squashed logo. Deliver the
`CREATIVE_DIRECTION.md` doc + the rendered files, and tell the user the exact paths.
